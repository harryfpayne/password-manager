# Password manager
I want to make a basic cli password manager, 
not secure enough to actually be used, but good enough.

## Goals
- Encrypted password storage
- Handle multiple users
- 'Shared' passwords, i.e. accessible by multiple users
- Try brute forcing a password, see how crazy that is

## What I know already
I have some pretty basic knowledge of cryptography, 
I did a CS degree so had a module in cryptography but being honest 
that was a few years ago, so I'll be a bit rusty. 
I vaguely remember AES which I'm pretty sure will be useful in this.
