# Actual Cryptography

I don't think I can put off implementing the actual cryptographic functions anymore, time to do some research.

Looking at implementations of AES online it doesn't look too tricky, I also need to implement a padding scheme, I think I'll go with one called PKCS#7.

## Problems encountered
While doing this I ran into a bug that was really hard to figure out. My Decrypt function takes in a byte slice
and was mutating that slice in place. This mutation was changing passwords in the vault object. I was adding logs
in to figure out what was going on, but everytime I decrypted anything in the logs the error would move somewhere
else. I eventually figured out that the error was happening in the decryption function, and to stop it I copy the
byte slice before decrypting it.

While researching for this I also figured out a question I had around how do we know if a password is incorrect.
Each entry should have an unencrypted hash of itself, then once decrypted we can compare the hash. I'll implement
that later.
