# Cryptography control flow

Today I'd like to get the control flow working for the encryption and decryption functions.

I don't know much about cryptography, at this stage I'm going to implement some dummy functions and
then replace them with real ones later.

I'm finding it tricky keeping track of what's encrypted at what stage, so I'm adding a wrapper object for
all strings that get encrypted, which stores the string and if it's currently encrypted.

After today's batch of work passwords can be added, stored, encrypted and decrypted. If the password is wrong 
when trying to decrypt then the output password will be wrong.

A question that came up while working on this, how do I know if the password is wrong? Do they usually store some
known string to verify the password? Or maybe it's a hash of the password string. Both of these seem like they could
leak information about the password, so I'm not sure what the best way to do it is. Needs some research.
