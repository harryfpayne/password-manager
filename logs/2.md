# Starting implementation

Ok time to actually start making this, lets see how it goes.
I think this will be a cli so there's a few modules I can break this up into:
- [ ] file system read / write.
- [ ] crypto module for encrypting / decrypting data, and generating keys.
- [ ] cli commands, add / remove / search / etc.

I'll probably work on the file system bit first. At the moment I'm ignoring a lot of the cryptography stuff e.g. MAC's.
I'll deal with them when I'm working on the crypto module. So at the moment I'm focusing on making a generic read / write
file module so I can change the data structures later.

## Impl
Ok I've made a basic file system, I've wanted to keep it as generic as possible, here's some design considerations I've made:
### Config struct
The config for how to read the file should be configurable, I'm representing this with a `Config` object
ReadVault and WriteVault are then methods on that object.

### Vault types
I think I'm going to store everything in a single file, 1password stored profiles separate, but that feels unnecessary
for my use case. So the vault file has two fields at the moment, `Profiles` and `Entries`, at this stage the structure
of these isn't decided but I think it'll probably look similar to this.
